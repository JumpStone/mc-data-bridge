GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use this
General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any
other work released this way by its authors. You can use it for your
programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these
rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of software, or if you
modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1)
assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving
you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such
abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed
this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.
If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to
extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as
needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on
general-purpose computers, but in fact they do. A world-wide patent
license free of charge is probably the only way to make an entire program
always free to use, study, and run. For this reason, we insist on patent
license from any contributor to a program covered by this version of the
GPL who might otherwise want to assert patents to stop your use of the
program.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                           TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for copyright
infringement, except executing it on a computer network without requiring
registration or payment of fees. Propagating includes copying, public
display, public performance, distribution or dissemination of a covered
work in any form, and modifying, translating, disassembling, or reverse
engineering the work as a whole into a different legal format.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a
computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells
the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent
that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under
this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface
 presents a list of user commands or options, such as an executable file
invoked through a command line interface, then the copyright notice and
a link to the license are sufficient.

  A "contributor" is an author or other entity who authorizes use of
copyright under this License.

  An "essential patent claim" is a patent claim (herein, a "patent")
which, absent its license, would necessarily be infringed by making,
using, or selling a covered work, solely because of having performed
that covered work according to its technical specifications.
"Necessarily infringed" means that no technologically feasible way of
performing the covered work exists without infringing that patent claim.

  A "contributor version" is a version of the Program: (a) for which the
contributor has direct copyright liability, or (b) which the contributor
has received under this License.

  A "licensee version" is any work that has been created by a licensee
and is covered by this License.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a
work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major
Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for that Major Component.

  A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential
component (kernel, window system, etc.) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce
the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System
Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs
which are used unmodified in performing the work but which are not part
of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface
definition files associated with source files, and the source code for
shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication
or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
reproduce from the work's object code by running an appropriate
installer or extracter.

The Corresponding Source for a work in module form need not include the
source code for the module itself, if the module is designed to work
with a Major Component, and the module is not part of the Major
Component.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, constituting
copyrightable work, is released under this License. You may make, run
and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without condition.

  3. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive
terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all
warranties; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the
Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and
you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  4. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
of section 3, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
    under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
    requirement modifies the requirement in section 3 to "keep intact all
    notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
    to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
    therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional
    terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how
    they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the
    work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if
    you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    "Appropriate Legal Notices"; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display "Appropriate Legal Notices", your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and
which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or
on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate". When this License applies to a covered work in an
aggregate, the other works in the aggregate are not covered by this
License.

  5. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 3 and 4, provided that you also convey the
Corresponding Source in a medium customarily used for software interchange.

  Alternatively, you may convey the Corresponding Source by offering
access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
charge, provided you notify recipients that they may do so. This is for
a work in object code form, and the Corresponding Source is not part of
the work. The Corresponding Source must be available at least as long as
the object code is available, and must be in a format that is generally
recognized as suitable for interchange.

  Alternatively, you may convey the Corresponding Source by providing
recipients with a copy of the Corresponding Source along with the object
code. This is for a work in object code form, and the Corresponding
Source is part of the work.

  You may also convey the Corresponding Source by providing recipients
with a copy of the Corresponding Source along with the object code. This
is for a work in object code form, and the Corresponding Source is part
of the work.

  A separate fee may be charged for the physical act of conveying a copy
of Corresponding Source. This option is allowed only if you are conveying
the object code in a physical product, and the Corresponding Source is
conveyed on a durable physical medium (such as a CD-ROM) or is provided
with a written offer to provide the Corresponding Source for a fee no
larger than the cost of performing this physically conveying of source,
and the Corresponding Source is part of the work.

  6. Corresponding Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in object code form means all the
source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)
run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control
those activities. However, it does not include the work's System
Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs
which are used unmodified in performing the work but which are not part
of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface
definition files associated with source files, and the source code for
shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication
or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
reproduce from the work's object code by running an appropriate
installer or extracter.

The Corresponding Source for a work in module form need not include the
source code for the module itself, if the module is designed to work
with a Major Component, and the module is not part of the Major
Component.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be
treated as if they were included in this License, to the extent that they
are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to
part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those
permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License
without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove
any additional permissions from that copy. (Additional permissions may be
set to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the
work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to
a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright
permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, if you have or can obtain copyright permission,
you may choose to license that material under terms of your choice, provided
that, in your licensing of that material, you comply with the requirement
of this License to license the entire work, as a whole, under this License.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify
it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License.

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to
notify you of the violation by any reasonable means prior to 30 days
after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and
you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this
License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not
give you any rights to use it.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring
solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a
copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than
this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.
These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.
Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives
a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that
work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with this License.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is an author or other entity who authorizes use of
copyright under this License.

  A "contributor version" is a version of the Program: (a) for which the
contributor has direct copyright liability, or (b) which the contributor
has received under this License.

  An "essential patent claim" is a patent claim (herein, a "patent")
which, absent its license, would necessarily be infringed by making,
using, or selling a covered work, solely because of having performed
that covered work according to its technical specifications.
"Necessarily infringed" means that no technologically feasible way of
performing the covered work exists without infringing that patent claim.

  "Licensee version" is any work that has been created by a licensee
and is covered by this License.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that
legally obligate you not to convey copies of the Program for a fee, then
the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be
to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under
version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined
work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will
continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the terms of
the GNU Affero General Public License will apply to the whole ensemble
whenever it is a GNU Affero General Public License work.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of
any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public
License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING
ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS
OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing
courts shall apply this License's terms in a way that best approximates
an absolute waiver of all liability in connection with the Program, unless
a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies the Program in writing.

                           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
