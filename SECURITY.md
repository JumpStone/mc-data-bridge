# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use the following table to report vulnerabilities to the maintainers:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.x.x   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We prefer that **severe vulnerabilities** or **exploits** be reported by opening a **Pull Request (PR)** containing the fix, if possible. This allows us to review and merge the fix securely and quickly.

If you are unable to provide a fix, or if the issue is sensitive but you cannot create a PR, you may still use the [Security Vulnerability Report](#) issue template.

For standard **bugs** and **feature requests**, please use the regular [Issue Tracker](../../issues).
